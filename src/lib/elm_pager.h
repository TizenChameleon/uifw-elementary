 *
 * @brief Widget that allows flipping between one or more “pages”
 * of objects.
 *
 * The flipping between pages of objects is animated. All content
 * in the pager is kept in a stack, the top being the last content added
 * (visible one) on the top of that stack.
 *
 * Objects can be pushed or popped from the stack or deleted as
 * well. Pushes and pops will animate the widget according to its
 * style (a pop will also delete the child object once the
 * animation is finished). Any object already in the pager can be
 * promoted to the top (from its current stacking position) through
 * the use of elm_pager_content_promote(). New objects are pushed
 * to the top with elm_pager_content_push(). When the top item is
 * no longer wanted, simply pop it with elm_pager_content_pop() and
 * it will also be deleted. If an object is no longer needed and is
 * not the top item, just delete it as normal. You can get the objects 
 * at the top and bottom with
 * elm_pager_content_top_get() and elm_pager_content_bottom_get() 
 * respectively.
 *
 * Signals that you can add callbacks for are:
 * - @c "show,finished" - when a new page is actually shown on the top
 * - @c "hide,finished" - when a previous page is hidden
 *
 * Only after the first of that signals the child object is
 * guaranteed to be visible, as in @c evas_object_visible_get().
 *
 * This widget has the following styles available:
 * - @c "default"
 *
 * @note These styles affect only the flipping animations on the
 * default theme; the appearance when not animating is unaffected
 * by them.
 *
 * @ref tutorial_pager gives a good overview of the usage of the API.

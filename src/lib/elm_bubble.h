 * @brief The Bubble is a widget to show text similar to how speech is
 * represented in comics.
 *
 * The bubble widget contains 5 important visual elements:
 * @li The frame is a rectangle with rounded edjes and an "arrow".
 * @li The @p icon is an image to which the frame's arrow points to.
 * @li The @p label is a text which appears to the right of the icon if the
 * corner is "top_left" or "bottom_left" and is right aligned to the frame
 * otherwise.
 * @li The @p info is a text which appears to the right of the label. Info's
 * font is of a ligther color than label.
 * @li The @p content is an evas object that is shown inside the frame.
 *
 * The position of the arrow, icon, label and info depends on which corner is
 * selected. The four available corners are:
 * @li "top_left" - Default
 * @li "top_right"
 * @li "bottom_left"
 * @li "bottom_right"
 *
 * Signals that you can add callbacks for are:
 * @li "clicked" - This is called when a user has clicked the bubble.
 *
 * Default contents parts of the bubble that you can use for are:
 * @li "default" - A content of the bubble
 * @li "icon" - An icon of the bubble
 *
 * Default text parts of the button widget that you can use for are:
 * @li NULL - Label of the bubble
 *
 * For an example of using a buble see @ref bubble_01_example_page "this".
